Hello.

My name is Ott and currently, I'm a front end developer working at Pipedrive. Outside of that, my main goal is to attend to my animals and help with animal welfare as much as possible.

With my free time, I'm mostly spending it to attend university and work on various side projects. If there is anything left over I usually spend it on long walks and cycling.
