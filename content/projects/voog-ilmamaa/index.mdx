## About

The project was completed for an Estonian publishing house "Ilmamaa".
Their work is mainly focused on publishing cultural works under the "Avatud Eesti raamatu" series.

## Summary

Our work was mostly oriented in migrating a legacy custom-built Ruby site to use [Voog CMS](/projects/voog-cms).
The end goal was to enable the customer to use the e-commerce capabilities introduced by [Voog](/projects/voog-cms) during the same period.

My work was focused on writing the migration scripts to handle the database migration and application testing.
I also worked on building improved template support for new and existing content areas and data entry capabilities.
