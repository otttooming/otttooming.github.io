For the course of "Multimedia design" we were tasked in creating a poster to celebrate the 97th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia.

The requirements were set to include national symbols of Estonia and to be presentable among the school grounds for upcoming celebrations.

My submission was based on minimal aesthetics that encompassed the visual themes from both the flag of Estonia and the educational institution.
