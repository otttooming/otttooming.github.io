For an introduction to the "Graphic design" course in Tartu KHK, the students were tasked with creating a poster to represent visually what our idea for the upcoming course thematic would be.

The requirements were freeform and only restricted based on our technical capabilities what we could accomplish during the one academic class allocated for this task.

My presentation was based on the digital lifecycle of the design process. From the input of the artist to the final product with all of the technical intermediates that are usually transparent.

Loosely inspired by the Steve Jobs citation "The computer is a bicycle for our minds".
