## About

Telia is a leading telecommunications provider in Estonia with wide-reaching vertical integration in the B2C market.

## Summary

The main responsibilities included in transforming design assets from designers to common reusable components for integration into business logic.

My work included in building front-end solutions for established Java services using plain CSS and static HTML structures for integration. Also separately building atomic React components and intricate layouts for integration into modern microservices.

It was a great opportunity to work on something touched by an enormous amount of people while employing the best effort put into it by a culmination of work by UX analysts and developers.
