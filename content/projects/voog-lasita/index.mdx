Worked on building a new company website from the ground up and an e-commerce presence utilizing VOOG CMS.

Main considerations were to complete the design layout to work with all the dynamic aspects of the CMS platform while maintaing visual coherency.

Feeding back on designers with input to responvsive layouts and content management possibilities for optimal client expectations and the best user experience.
