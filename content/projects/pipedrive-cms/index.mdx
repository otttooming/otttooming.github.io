## About

Pipedrive is a CRM platform made for salespeople, by salespeople. Offering a cloud-based SaaS CRM that is both easy use and simple to scale.

## Summary

I have been working in Pipedrive as a software developer in building React components for micro frontends and Node.js microservices with the latest ECMAScript/TypeScript.

Handling design materials for front-end development using Figma, Sketch and Zeplin.

Participating in internal lean UX hackathons to bring innovative new approaches and new domain specific perspectives to the platform.

## Highlights

Solving business problems with some of the most creative and emphatic coworkers has been a dream. Hopefully, our work together has brought real measurable change to the way people perceive Pipedrive and the sales process in general.

Here are some of the concrete problems we are focused on handling.

### Complex forms

Our work intrinsically includes developing complex forms for intuitive data entry to our customers as well as handling validation and data interdependencies.

### Flexible components

Working to bring into realization atomic components that are built with a standard design system for optimal reusability and to deliver the most intuitive HCI possible.
