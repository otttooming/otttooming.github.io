## About

Rocca Towers is the newest residential and business quarter in Tallinn.

Our work was to build a complete technical solution for the real estate agency Endover to promote and market their brand-new development.

## Summary

Worked with the front end team to build UI components and templates using Twig templating library and TypeScript.

The project was a cooperation with an external design agency for a renowned Estonian real estate development company Endover.
Providing a tight collaboration network between all parties to establish a perfectly harmonized result.

Was part of a an amazing team with a tight collaboration that created a full WordPress solution with an integration to analytics and sales processes.

## Highlights

My personal effort was directed at creating the layout and atomic components that could be reused throughout any template while still offerring enchanting visual presentation.
