Worked in a team where we were tasked in building a new microservice for the business delivery dashboard.
Part of the greater expansion for logistics infrastructure that is already used by thousands of users in the Baltic sea region.

Tasked in working with the UX team to deliver complex design systems into user-facing solutions and iterate through different feedback channels to create engaging solutions.

From a technical point, we were using React and Redux for our front end solution while consuming various microservices collated by a separate gateway.
Utilizing TypeScript to ensure type safety and Jest for unit/integration tests.
