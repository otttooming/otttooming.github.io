## About

Diil is a subdivision of Telia Company AB. A Swedish multinational telephone company and mobile network operator present in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

## Summary

Worked in building React UI components using TypeScript and BEM methodology for consumption in both the public web as well as in the self-service portal.

Our task was to create both new and backport existing components from existing component libraries.

Emphasis was put on clear and concise documentation and type declarations. To deliver the best DX for component consumption by a large-scale network of internal teams as well as sub-contractors.
