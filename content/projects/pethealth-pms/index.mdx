Worked with an amazing team to build PetHealth patient management software for Student Startup Camp 2019 where we won the ["Best Design Special Award"](http://ideelabor.ut.ee/news/student-startup-camp-2019-winners-are-here).

We were shortlisted for the Garage48 Base Camp Spring 2019 hackathon where we got directed by an amazing group of mentors ["Base Camp Vol.2 Magnifies the Entire Hackathon Experience"](http://garage48.org/blog/base-camp-vol-2-magnifies-the-entire-hackathon-experience).

For the technical side, we used React and Node.js microservices approach. Powered by the amazing Prisma Client we rapidly iterated our MVP to validate our business idea.

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ott and I want to present to you why we built PetHealth and why we think that improving collaboration in veterinary medicine is important.

First of all, I want to introduce our amazing team, that we assembled in the Student Startup Camp 2019 that was held in Tartu.

Kaarel Loide - front-end developer
Aksel Jänes - designer
Kustas Budrikas - designer
Anette Kuklane - Business and Marketing
Aysen Suleymanova - front-end developer
Kertrud Järg - analyst, product management
Ott Tooming - team lead, full-stack developer

All of us are students and continuing our education in various disciplines,
ranging from "Media and Advertisement Design" in Pallas University of Applied Sciences to "Web technologies" in Estonian Entrepreneurship University of Applied Sciences.

We are enthusiastic about our field but also have had strong experience in the wider SaaS industry while working for Pipedrive, Voog and various smaller companies.

## What are we

Our platform is dedicated to providing a solution that empowers and enhances animal healthcare through collaboration between veterinary doctors.

We want to reduce the barrier for veterinarians to communicate their diagnostic requirements.
In doing so, this will unleash the true potential for vets to concentrate on the patient and offer them the best available care they can provide.

And, beyond the specific facilitation, we believe it can usher in a greater understanding of the medical conditions veterinarians are faced daily.
We see tremendous potential in collating patient records and applying analytical oversight over the materials in future diagnostic quality.

# Established situation

Current established practices and solutions in the market do not adequately enable full potential in communicating patient diagnosis.
This in itself restricts effective patient care that could be delivered.

While there are plethora of soultions on the market offering patient management systems, all of them are limited to a silo for specific clinic
and don't tap into the collaborative potential of the field.

Currently, no software in the market allows both shared communication and shared access to patient medical history between different institutions.

On the other hand, creating a platform from the ground up to facilitate consultations and shared record as a first class citizens,
we will connect veterinarians to their colleagues in the field.

## Market

Veterinary healthcare is a stable and continuous market both in Estonia and the rest of the world.
In Estonia alone, there are approximately 90 small-animal clinics, from 1 up to 20 veterinary doctors per clinic.

## Our bjectives

PetHealth will offer an intuitive to use SaaS solution where we strive to create superior value for our customers through reduction in the length of the diagnostic process.

- Improve and make the work of veterinary doctors efficient and easier
- Enhance the availability, transparency, and quality of veterinary medicine
- Provide a platform for learning for younger doctors and a platform for continuous learning for experienced professionals

## Our keys to success

- Intuitive to use and efficient service that will build and maintain customer loyalty
- Strong market connections and relationships with educational institutions
- Unique selling point - providing software currently not existing in it's specific niche
- Our commitment to providing improved diagnostic quality and continuous improvement in record analytics
