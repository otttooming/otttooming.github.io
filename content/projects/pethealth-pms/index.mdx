Worked with an amazing team to build PetHealth patient management software for Student Startup Camp 2019 where we won the ["Best Design Special Award"](http://ideelabor.ut.ee/news/student-startup-camp-2019-winners-are-here).

We were shortlisted for the Garage48 Base Camp Spring 2019 hackathon where we got directed by an amazing group of mentors.

For the technical side we used React and Node.js microservices approach. Powered by the amazing Prisma Client we rapidly iterated our MVP to validate our business idea.
