Worked with an amazing team to build PetHealth patient management software for Student Startup Camp 2019 where we won the ["Best Design Special Award"](http://ideelabor.ut.ee/news/student-startup-camp-2019-winners-are-here).

We were shortlisted for the Garage48 Base Camp Spring 2019 hackathon where we got directed by an amazing group of mentors ["Base Camp Vol.2 Magnifies the Entire Hackathon Experience"](http://garage48.org/blog/base-camp-vol-2-magnifies-the-entire-hackathon-experience).

For the technical side, we used React and Node.js microservices approach. Powered by the amazing Prisma Client we rapidly iterated our MVP to validate our business idea.

## Introduction

Our solution is dedicated to providing solutions that empower and enrich animal healthcare through intuitive collaboration between veterinary doctors.

Current established practices and solutions in the market do not adequately enable full potential in communicating patient diagnosis.
This in itself restricts effective patient care that could be delivered.

## Market

Veterinary healthcare is a stable and continuous market both in Estonia and the rest of the world.
In Estonia alone, there are approximately 90 small-animal clinics, from 1 up to 20 veterinary doctors per clinic.
Currently, no software in the market allows both communication and access to patient medical history.

PetHealth will offer an easy to use, reasonably priced, quality product, generate fair and equitable returns, have continuous support and create superior value for customers.

## Objectives

- Improve and make the work of veterinary doctors efficient and easier.
- Enhance the availability, transparency, and quality of veterinary medicine in Estonia.
- Provide quality customer support and build strong relationships with clients.
- Provide a platform for learning for younger doctors and a platform for continuous learning for experienced professionals.
- To break even and generate positive cash flow from operations within the first six months.

## Our keys to success

- Easy to use, efficient and inexpensive service that will build and maintain customer loyalty.
- Strong market connections and relationships.
- Unique selling point - providing software currently not existing for Estonian veterinary clinics.
- Our commitment to providing quality service and continuous improvement.
